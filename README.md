   <h3><b>Onimai OS</b> is a Linux distribution <b>made for onimai fans</b>, based on Nyarch Linux and EzArcher.</h3><br />

<div align="left">

## Is it safe to use?
It is strongly suggested to <b>do not use this Linux distribution as daily drive</b>, since it is not made by a team of experts and there are way better distros out there. <br />
<br />
If you want to use it anyways, <b>Onimai OS is nothing more than a heavily bloated Arch Linux install script</b>, it relies on Arch Linux standard repositories, so for normal packages you will receive frequent updates that do not depend on us, however, you may encounter issues with Gnome Extensions on Gnome updates.
